>"doesn't produce any noticeable results". Not with my testing. Going from Medium to Slow made a big difference in retaining very fine grain / details, even at CRF 18. Slow is the best speed/quality preset for x265, which I get around 24-30fps with.

>When pushing CRF higher, you actually want to use the slower speeds, as it will increase the quality per bitrate. (4,000kbps on fast vs 4,000kbps on Slower will look much better on Slower).

>I personally like to use preset Slow and then use 'several' settings from Slower. It renders 1080p content at 12fps on my 7950x, which is still very fast for me. Using the full Slower preset goes down to 3-5fps, depending on content, which I might run while I'm working, and it's done by the time I'm done with work.
