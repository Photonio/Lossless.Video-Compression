>For encoding lossless RGB with x264, you should use the command line version of x264 (you can't trust GUIs in this edge case, they will probably mess-up) r2020 or newer, with something like that:
>
>`x264 --qp 0 --preset fast --input-csp rgb --output-csp rgb --colormatrix GBR --output "the_lossless_output.mkv" "someinput.avs"`
>
>Any losses/differences between the input and output should be from some colour space conversion (either before encoding, or at playback), wrong settings or some header/meta-data that was lost. x264 don't supports RGBA, but RGB is ok. YUV 4:4:4 compression is more efficient, but you will lose some data in colour space conversion as your input is RGB. YV12/i420 is much smaller, and by far the most common colour space in video, but you have less chroma resolution.
